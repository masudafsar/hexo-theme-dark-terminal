        It’s that time of the year. The time to make resolutions and set goals for the coming twelve months. I keep
        reading that the key to achieving your goals is accountability. Some people even built webapps to help with
        habit creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I must admit I’m not a massive fan of resolutions and I much prefer goals as I find them to be more specific.
        This allows me to focus on creating the appropriate systems to give life to my visions.

        By publishing this post, I intend to share with you the list of goals that I have set for myself so I can
        hopefully look back and see all (or at least most) the boxes ticked.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have divided my goals into three categories: Career, Creativity and Health.
